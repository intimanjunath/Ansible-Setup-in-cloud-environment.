CMPE-272- Ansible assessment

I deployed three virtual machines and configured an Ansible server on VM1 to manage the deployment of a web server on VM2 and VM3. The web server runs on port 8080 and displays the message: "Hello World from SJSU." 

The Ansible playbook includes tasks to both deploy and undeploy all web server resources.

For a detailed explanation of the process and results, please refer to the Word document submitted on Canvas.
